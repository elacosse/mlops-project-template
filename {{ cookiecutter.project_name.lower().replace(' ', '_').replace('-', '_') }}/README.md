## Folder structure of the project
Cookiecutter is used to create a standardized template for a folder structure for projects. Below is an example of such a template created using Cookiecutter:
    
    ├── AUTHORS.md
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── bin                 <- Your compiled model code can be stored here (not tracked by git)
    ├── config              <- Configuration files
    ├── data                
    │   ├── 0-external      <- Data external to the project.
    │   ├── 1-interim       <- Intermediate data that has been altered.
    │   ├── 2-input         <- The processed datasets, ready for modeling.
    │   ├── 3-output        <- Data dump from the model.
    │   └── 4-evaluate      <- Post-processed data, ready for visualisation.
    ├── docs                <- Documentation, e.g., doxygen or scientific papers (not tracked by git)
    ├── notebooks           <- Jupyter notebooks
    ├── reports             <- For a manuscript source, e.g., LaTeX, Markdown, etc., or any project reports
    │   └── figures         <- Figures for the manuscript or reports
    └── src                 <- Source code for this project
        ├── 0-setup         <- Install necessary software, dependencies, pull other git projects, etc.

        ├── 3-model         <- Scripts to run model and convert or compress model results, from 3-input to 4-output.
        ├── 4-analyze       <- Scripts to post-process model results, from 4-output to 5-visualization.
        └── 5-evaluate      <- Scripts for evaluation of your results, from 5-evaluate to ./report/figures.


## Very first steps

### Initialize your code

1. Initialize `git` inside your repo:

```bash
cd {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} && git init
```

2. If you don't have `Poetry` installed run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

3. Initialize poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

4. Run the codestyle:

```bash
make codestyle
```

5. Upload initial code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_name }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Set up bots

- Set up [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates) to ensure you have the latest dependencies.
- Set up [Stale bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) for automatic issue closing.

### Poetry

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc
</p>
</details>



## Installation

```bash
pip install -U {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
```

{% if cookiecutter.create_example_template == 'cli' -%}Then you can run

```bash
{{ cookiecutter.project_name }} --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} --help
```{%- endif %}

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_name }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade` and `ruff`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_name }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/tree/master/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
